Here we explain the key points that could affect your wallet. </p><h2>1.    Stamp Duty </h2><p>The biggest change is to Stamp Duty, which you pay when you buy a home. Until now you've paid stamp duty on the total purchase price of your new home, but now home buyers will be charged in a similar way to income tax.  </p><p>So, if you buy a home costing more than £125,000 you will pay no tax on the first £125,000 and 2% on the portion up to £250,000. The rate you pay increases on subsequent chunks as the value goes up. Previously the homeowner would pay 1% on the total up to £250,000, or more if the property value was higher.  </p><p>As with the old system, higher rates apply as the price of the property increases through different bands. But instead of the rate applying to the whole value of the property, it will only apply to the chunk of the selling price that falls into each tax band.  </p><p>The Treasury estimates 98% of people who buy a home will pay less stamp duty. </p><p>Anyone who has exchanged contracts by 3 December, but not completed, can choose to pay under the old system or the new one.  </p><p><img src=\\\"/images/15936361772_d3a2012747_z.jpg\\\"/>  </p><p>The new Stamp Duty bands are: </p><p>•    0% on the first £125,000 paid </p><p>•    2% on properties costing between £125,001 and £250,000 </p><p>•    5% on properties costing between £250,001 and £925,000 </p><p>•    10% on properties costing between £925,001 and £1,500,000 </p><p>•    12% on properties costing £1,500,001 and over. </p><p><a title=\\\"HM Treasury Stamp Duty fact sheet\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/382324/Stamp_Duty_15.pdf\\\">Read more on the Stamp Duty changes in this HM Treasury fact sheet.</a></p><h2>2.    Tax-free savings </h2><p>As expected the annual<a title=\\\"ISAs and other tax efficient ways to save and invest\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/isas-and-other-tax-efficient-ways-to-save-or-invest\\\"> ISA</a> (Individual Savings Account) limit will rise in April 2015, to £15,240. Junior ISAs and Child Trust Funds are also rising, to £4,080. </p><p>Another change means savings and investments held in the account of an ISA holder who dies can be transferred to their spouse or civil partner’s ISA, so they do not lose the tax benefit. The surviving partner’s allowance would not be affected.  </p><h2>3.    Pensions </h2><p>The 55% 'death tax' – which would usually be applied when an unused pension pot is passed on – will be abolished from next April. </p><p>A new policy will also ensure people who die before age 75 with a joint life or guaranteed term annuity could also pass these on to a spouse or civil partner tax-free.   </p><p><a title=\\\"Age related personal allowances\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/categories/types-of-pensions\\\">Learn more about Types of pensions.</a></p><h2>4.    Family holidays </h2><p>From 1 May 2015 air passenger duty is to be abolished for under 12s travelling on all economy flights. From March 2016, this change will cover all under 16s. The scrapping of this duty for children will help boost savings to family holidays at up to £71 per child. Air passenger duty is an extra charge imposed on passengers flying from an airport in the United Kingdom or Isle of Man. </p><p><a title=\\\"Get holidays for less\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/get-holidays-for-less\\\">Get holidays for less. </a></p><h2>5.    Tax-free personal allowance </h2><p>The threshold at which people start to pay income tax will rise to £10,600 in April 2015, an increase of £600 a year and £100 more than was previously announced. That means earners will take home an extra £120 a year. It also means no one on the minimum wage will pay any income tax. </p><p>The personal allowance threshold for higher rate taxpayers will also rise – from £41,865 to £42,385 next year. You'll pay 40% in tax on anything above that amount. This is the first increase in five years. </p><p><a title=\\\"Age related personal allowances\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/age-related-personal-allowances\\\">Personal allowances explained.</a></p><h2>6.    Student loans </h2><p>From 2016/17 anyone aged under 30 and studying on a post-grad masters course will be entitled to take out a student loan of up to £10,000 in total. The aim is to help more students from poorer backgrounds afford further study. </p><p>To support students until the loans start, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) will allocate £50 million in 2015-16 so universities can offer bursaries on a match funded basis. These will be £10,000 each and will benefit 10,000 students. </p><h2>7.    Petrol prices to stay the same </h2><p>Finally, it was also announced that duty on petrol prices will stay the same. So prices at the pumps won't be affected. </p><p><a title=\\\"How to save fuel when driving\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-to-save-fuel-when-driving\\\">Tips to save fuel when driving </a></p>\",\"title\":\"Autumn Statement: Seven changes that could affect your wallet\",\"titleTag\":\"\",\"metaDescription\":\"\",\"preview\":\"Alongside the annual Budget, the Government uses the \\\"Autumn Statement\\\" to reveal new economic and financial policies.

This year saw the highest number of cars bought on finance – 75.8%, up by 12% from last year – according to figures from the Finance &amp; Leasing Association. That’s worth £13.7 billion pounds. </p><p>If you’re thinking of buying a new car and can’t pay cash, here are three things you need to know about financing. </p><h2>1.    There’s more than one way to get finance </h2><p>Hire purchase (HP) is often the simplest car finance plan. You’re hiring the car until you’ve paid the full amount. These plans can be quite flexible, with terms of one to five years commonly available. Of course the longer you spread the payments, the more the car will cost. </p><p>You can borrow money in other ways too. Personal loans are often the cheapest way to borrow in the long term. Use the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) charged for the borrowing to compare interest and get an idea of which is the best deal. </p><p>Another option is a PCP - or a personal contract purchase. This is leasing with an option to buy the car at the end for an additional amount. Monthly payments are often lower. </p><p><a data-type=\\\"action\\\" hreflang=\\\"en\\\" href=\\\"/content/guides/car-finance-explained\\\">Read more about the different ways of financing a car</a></p><h2>2.    You don’t have the same rights as buying with cash </h2><p>With HP, if you get into financial difficulties and can’t afford the repayments, the finance company could take the car away from you. And if this happens before you’ve paid a third of the total due, your car can be repossessed without a court order. Double check there are no penalties for paying it off early either and make sure you understand what will happen if you miss a payment. </p><p>You also can’t sell the car when you want as it’s not yours until all payments have been made, and you need to let the finance company know if you want to take the car abroad. </p><h2>3.    You can shop around for the best deals </h2><p>Just because your dealer is offering one finance package, you don’t have to take it. It’s a good idea to shop around many other brokers to see if they can do any better. </p><p>The better your credit rating, the lower interest rate deal you’ll be able to get. </p><p><a data-type=\\\"action\\\" hreflang=\\\"en\\\" href=\\\"/content/tools/car-costs-calculator\\\">Before committing to any of these, try our Car costs calculator to get an idea of the real cost of your car.</a></p>\",\"title\":\"The three things you need to know about financing a new car\",\"titleTag\":\"\",\"metaDescription\":\"\",\"preview\":\"More new cars than ever are being bought on finance\",\"publicationDate\":\"2014-11-26T12:15:12.723Z\",\"translationId\":null,\"locale\":\"en\",\"categories\":[],\"topic\":\"Tips and tools\",\"largeImage\":null,\"previewImage\":null},{\"id\":\"universal-credit-arrives-for-families\",\"body\":\"<p class=\\\"intro\\\">Universal Credit is extended to families from today in some parts of the country. </p><p>The days of having to apply for multiple benefits are drawing to a close.

If you and your partner are eligible to receive the benefit it will be paid into one account to make life easier. </p><h2>Latest stage of Universal Credit </h2><p>Universal Credit is being rolled out in waves, and the latest will benefit some parents in the north west of England.

Getting stocked up on crackers and cranberry sauce isn’t going to be a problem, but that sweater for uncle Frank which turns out to be the wrong size could be an issue if the date for returns has passed by the time he’s opened it up on Christmas morning. </p><h2>Deadlines for returns could catch you out </h2><p>While UK consumer law means retailers have to let you return most purchases, the timescales do vary and the deadlines could catch you out if it turns out something needs to go back to the shop. </p><p>Under the <a title=\\\"Your rights\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/news/protect-against-unexpected-costs-by-knowing-your-consumer-rights\\\">Consumer Contracts Regulations</a> you can let a retailer know you want to return most unused items within 14 days of buying them or having them delivered. </p><p>If you made the purchase online or over the phone you have a further 14 days from the day you contacted the retailer to cancel in which to return the purchase. </p><p>With purchases you make online or over the phone, yet pick up in store, you can just return the item within the initial 14 days, or if you can't get to the store within this period, call them to cancel and arrange for a postal return.  </p><p>Tailored or personalised items (such as engraved jewellery, earrings and tickets for events) are not covered by these rules. </p><h2>Great cover, providing you don’t leave it too late </h2><p>We looked at 15 major retailers’ policies and we found all at least met the legal requirements when it came to returns, with several such as M&amp;S, Debenhams and GAP offering longer than the required period to return. </p><p>In some cases retailers will extend their returns deadlines around the Christmas period, but they probably won’t cover what you may have bought too early, especially if you’re unlikely to return them until the New Year. </p><h2>Top savings tips for early birds </h2><p>If you want to spread the cost of Christmas, here are some top tips: </p><p>•    Use our <a title=\\\"Cut-back calculator\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/christmas-cut-back-calculator\\\">Christmas cut-back calculator</a> to see where savings can be made, and put this money somewhere safe to build up a Christmas fund. </p><p>•    Double check with your friends and relatives before buying expensive presents, make sure you’ve bagged specific purchases so you don't double up – especially if you’re looking to purchase them early. </p><p>•    Shop around for the cheapest, reputable seller. There are some less-than reliable firms out there, and you don’t want to end up waiting until after Christmas for deliveries (especially if you could have bought them in the sales). </p><p>•    If you have to return an online product, inform the retailer in writing (if possible). This way you reduce the chance of them not accepting a return within their own or the Consumer Contracts Regulations limits. </p><p>•    Some retailers will offer a credit note when you could be entitled to a cash refund – such as if you bought an item (not tickets, for example). You can reject this, but only if you haven’t accepted a credit note. <a title=\\\"Citizens Advice\\\" href=\\\"http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/wales/consumer_w/faq_index_consumer_affairs/faq_consumer_affairs_credit_notes_and_returned_goods.htm\\\">Citizens Advice</a> has more information on credit notes. </p><p>•    Many companies will allow you to return items that are the wrong size, providing they haven’t been worn (other than to try on).

You might get a discount there and then, or the chance to earn points and other rewards. It can seem like a great way to save, but it’s not always money for nothing. </p><p>In reality you might be picking up a store card rather than a loyalty card. With a store card you could be entering into a credit agreement, with high interest rates, charges and the potential to get into debt. </p><p>Store cards are often sold by sales assistants rather than financial experts, sothe focus tends to be on the offers you’ll get, and not the possible cost implications – and that can come at a high cost . </p><p>So how to do you know what you’re being offered? Here are four key differences between store cards and loyalty cards so you can spot the difference. </p><h2>Four differences between store cards and loyalty cards  </h2><p>1.    <strong>A store card works like a credit card</strong> you can only use in one shop or chain. Watch out for words or phrases such as “credit”, “monthly payments”, “APR”, “Buy now, pay later” or anything else that suggests you’re borrowing money. </p><p>2.    <strong>You don’t need to apply for a loyalty card</strong>.

Under the Sale of Goods Act 1979 purchases must be: </p><ul><li><strong>Fit for purpose</strong> – They must meet reasonable expectations, and be suitable for any requirements that you point out to the retailer when buying. For instance, if you are buying boots for hiking, they must be robust and waterproof if you make this need clear in a face-to-face conversation.</li><li><strong>Of satisfactory quality</strong> – Goods and services must be of a standard a reasonable person would regard as satisfactory, taking into account any description given of them</li><li><strong>As described</strong> – Whether you buy in-store, online or over the phone you have the right to expect your purchase to match the retailer’s description.</li></ul><h2>A reasonable life-cycle </h2><p>Retailers may be obliged to refund or replace a purchase if it’s reasonable to expect the product to last for longer than a certain period of time. For example, it’s reasonable to expect a £50 kettle to last longer than a £5 model. </p><h2>Sale of goods exceptions </h2><p>It’s worth noting the Sale of Goods Act won’t cover all problems, which is why regular savings could help you avoid unnecessary stress. For example, you can’t fall back on it if: </p><ul><li>The retailer pointed out any fault with the purchase before you paid</li><li>The fault was obvious and you had a reasonable chance to examine the item before buying</li><li>You subsequently change your mind about the purchase, such as if it is the wrong colour or size</li><li>You damage the goods.</li></ul><h2>Buying and returning goods </h2><p>You may have certain rights when buying items or services online or over the phone, which could help you avoid spending some of your emergency savings. </p><p>These rights are covered by the Consumer Contracts (Information, cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013. Basically, they require retailers to describe the product you are buying, include the total cost (including any delivery and returns costs), and rights to cancel. </p><p>If you want to cancel an order you’re allowed to: </p><ul><li>from the day you placed it until 14 days from the date you receive it.</li><li>return any cancelled goods within 14 days</li><li>you don’t have to give a reason for your decision. </li></ul><h2>Where you are not covered </h2><p>Certain goods and services aren’t covered under the regulations. Some of these include: </p><ul><li>Personalised items, such as engraved jewellery, tailored suits and fitted kitchens</li><li>Financial products and services</li><li>Earrings, underwear, and other items that might pose a health and safety risk, and can’t be resold.</li></ul><h2>Not what you expected? </h2><p>Sometimes the problem with a purchase is that it was mis-sold. If this is the case, you may be able to use the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 1998. This regulation covers you if something you were sold was described in a misleading way or an important fact was omitted. </p><h2>Card payments </h2><p>If you haven’t been able to resolve your problem after contacting the retailer it’s worth speaking to your payment card provider. If the purchase was between £100 and £30,000, and all or part of the payment was made on a credit card, <a title=\\\"Section 75 protection\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-youre-protected-when-you-pay-by-card\\\">Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974</a> can help. </p><p>If you spent less than £100 on a credit card or paid by debit card you can apply to your card provider for a refund under the Visa or MasterCard Chargeback scheme. </p><p>Knowledge of these rights and laws may help you avoid dipping into your emergency savings to cover unexpected costs. </p><h2>Find out more </h2><p>Visit the Which? website for more information on the <a title=\\\"sale of goods\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http://www.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/regulation/sale-of-goods-act\\\">Sale of Goods Act</a>, <a title=\\\"Consumer Contracts Regulations\\\" href=\\\"http://www.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/regulation/consumer-contracts-regulations\\\">Consumer Contracts Regulations</a> and <a title=\\\"consumer priotection\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http://www.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/regulation/consumer-protection-from-unfair-trading-regulations-2008\\\">Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations</a>. </p><h2>Checklist </h2><p><strong>1.

That’s according to the Association of British Insurers. Without insurance, you’ll have to cover emergency expenses on your own – the British Consulate can’t help you. </p><p>You should make sure the policy you choose is right for your needs. For example, you might need additional cover for winter sports, or if you have a medical condition, you might need specialist insurance. </p><p>There is no point hiding any medical conditions from your insurer either, even if it means a more expensive outlay in the first place. You should include everything you can, including any regular tablets you take. If you fail to, you could end up invalidating your policy. </p><p>If you are travelling in Europe, you should also get a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC). With an EHIC, you get the same level of state-provided medical care as someone who lives in the country you’re visiting. However, the local level of care may not be the same as what you’d get in the UK, so an EHIC is not enough on its own. You should still get travel insurance that includes medical and repatriation cover. </p><p>It’s not just medical treatment. Most insurance policies will cover lost or stolen bags, personal liability and more. </p><p>Insurance is essential.

Make sure when paying for travel money that you use a debit card or cash. Credit cards class it as a cash withdrawal and often charge interest and a separate fee. </p><p>The best exchange rates are often online, but there are pitfalls to going down this route. For example, you could be looking at a delivery charge of up to £5 and you may not be given the option to choose what notes you want. </p><p>Taking foreign currency with you isn’t the only way to pay on holiday though. It might be easier – and even cheaper - to use your credit card or debit card abroad; get a pre-paid card; or use traveller’s cheques. Make sure you know the fees before you travel.

In fact, the first day back at work in January, which this year is 5 January, is nicknamed ‘Divorce Day’ by lawyers – the day in the year divorce proceedings are most likely to start. </p><p>If you are thinking about divorcing, it can seem like a daunting time. But there are things you can do to make sure you are armed with the correct information to help tackle divorce practicalities. </p><p>Here are six things you should consider. </p><h2>1.Work out how much professional help you need </h2><p>Do you need a solicitor? The answer depends on how complicated your finances are – and how amicable your split is. If you part on good terms and your finances aren’t too complicated, you don’t necessarily need one. You could arrange everything on your own or by using an online service, if you live in England or Wales. </p><p>If you do need more help, you can arrange for advice from a solicitor or mediator and do the paperwork yourself.

Try to reach an agreement about paying things such as bills as soon as you can because ignoring them could have implications for your credit rating or get you into debt. Plus, being able to agree on the smaller things puts you in a better position to reach agreement about the ‘bigger’ financial issues later on. </p><h2>3.Be prepared for the cost </h2><p>Divorce costs can be expensive, and unless you qualify for state help, it is something you and your ex-partner have to be prepared to pay for. </p><p>Whether or not you have to pay court fees will be dependent on your level of income and savings. Solicitor’s fees can add up, but if you are unable to pay upfront, there are other options. You should be wary of taking out a high interest loan however, as you may have trouble repaying it at a time when you are getting used to a change in your financial situation. </p><p> Let us help relieve the stress of divorce. Read our guide on how much <a title=\\\"How much divorce costs\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-much-does-divorce-or-dissolution-cost\\\">different divorce options cost</a>. </p><h2>4.Protect yourself and your finances </h2><p>Don’t forget to think about your own finances too. You will need to act quickly to protect them if the divorce is acrimonious. </p><p>If the home you shared is registered in your ex-partner’s name, you can register your interest to ensure it isn’t sold or re-mortgaged without you being told. </p><p>However, you should be aware that this doesn’t apply in Scotland. You have the right to live in the property for as long as you are married or in a civil partnership, but you will lose this right if you leave the property for two years or more. </p><h2>5.Don’t ignore your full mortgage payments </h2><p>If you have a joint mortgage, don’t forget that you are equally liable for the whole loan – not just repaying your half. So, if you keep up with your mortgage payments, but your partner doesn’t, you could find that both your credit ratings are affected. </p><p>Equally, if you have a joint bank account, you should inform your bank straightaway – if your partner racks up any debt, you will both be liable for it. </p><p>Find out more about <a title=\\\"Protecting your financial assets during divorce\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-to-protect-your-finances-during-divorce-or-dissolution\\\">protecting your financial assets</a>.  </p><h2>6.Call in an impartial third party </h2><p>Agreeing the financial terms of a divorce can be a long process. </p><p>A mediator can help you and your ex-partner to reach an agreement. A solicitor can also help you with this process, but if you require a lot of time with them, it can make reaching a settlement an expensive undertaking – so it is best to avoid arguing with your partner through a solicitor as much as possible. </p>\",\"title\":\"Considering untying the knot?

If you were considering a payday loan, you may need to think again - new rules from 2 January mean getting one could be more difficult. </p><p>The changes mean borrowers should pay back less, and there will be stricter affordability checks and better advice for customers. </p><p>But fewer people are likely to be able to get their hands on this short-term, high-cost credit.  </p><h2>What’s changed? </h2><p>From 2 January no borrower will repay more in fees and charges than they initially borrowed and any fees incurred for a missed repayment will be capped at £15. Also, interest and fees charged can’t be greater than 0.8% a day of the money borrowed. This means lower costs for most borrowers, as the charges don’t grow quickly over a short period of time. </p><p>These changes are on top of those already announced in 2014. Among these are a limit on the number of times a lender is able to roll over your loan and the number of attempts lenders can make to take money from your account – both being limited to twice. </p><h2>How will the new payday rules affect potential borrowers? </h2><p>The new payday loan rules aim to increase protection for borrowers who are struggling to make repayments. They’re intended to lower the cost of borrowing and increase protection for those who are at risk of escalating debt. </p><p>However, it’s expected the limits on what lenders can charge could see many shut up shop, making it more difficult for some borrowers to find a willing lender. In fact, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates this field, estimates around 70,000 people won’t be able to get a payday loan as a result of the rule changes. </p><h2>Payday loan brokers </h2><p>It’s not just lenders who will need to change how they work, as payday loan credit brokers are also affected by the new rules. </p><p>Some people may have used a payday loan credit broker to help find the best loan for them in the past. But some of these firms haven’t made it clear they are a credit broker and not a lender, and have been charging unauthorised fees for services not provided. In many cases the customer was unaware they’d been charged. </p><p>From 2 January credit brokers are required to make it clear to borrowers who they are and what services that they provide, including a breakdown of any fees they charge.  They also need to explain when these fees must be paid. </p><p>Most people don’t need to use a broker as it’s not difficult to do a little research and go directly to the lender.

Take a look at our <a title=\\\"Budget Planner\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/budget-planner\\\">Budget Planner</a> to see how you can take the first step towards better finances. </p><h2>2.Start saving </h2><p>When we asked members of our community, saving money was identified as a key goal for 2015, with people looking to save for a rainy day, holiday, new home or even next year's Christmas.  </p><p>This may seem challenging, but did you know that putting aside just £3 a day adds up to £1,095 over the course of a year? Put the money in a jar to watch it grow before your eyes – or even better, find a savings account that will <a title=\\\"Savings accounts\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/regular-savings-accounts\\\">help boost your money</a>. </p><p>Not sure how to find that £3? Well, could you get your caffeine fix by filling a Thermos at home, or walk to work instead of taking the bus? See our <a title=\\\"Cut Back Calculator\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/cut-back-calculator\\\">Cut Back Calculator</a> to find out where else you could cut back. The tool only takes five minutes to complete, but you could be rewarded with a nice boost in your savings. </p><h2>3.Take advantage of the increased cash ISAs allowance </h2><p>On 1 July 2014, Cash ISAs (Individual Savings Accounts) and Stocks and Shares ISAs were merged and renamed New ISAs – or NISAs with an increased allowance limit of £15,000. If you haven’t already taken advantage of your full allowance you have until April 5th 2015 to either open a new or put money into an existing ISA and take advantage of any tax free interest on your savings. </p><p>Next year’s ISA allowance is being increased to £15,240 from April 6th. However, watch out for teaser rates that lure you in only to drop after the introductory period, and do shop around to find the best available rates. </p><p>It always a good idea to set up a reminder to notify you when any bonus rate runs out to maximise your ISA returns. </p><h2>4.Check your credit report </h2><p>Struggling to get credit from your bank or a lender? It could have something to do with your credit report. A credit report details your credit history, including a list of all your accounts, and helps a company assess how risky it would be to lend to you. </p><p>Our research has shown two in three UK adults have never checked their credit report. </p><p>We asked our Tell MA Community about their experiences with credit reports. Many people didn’t know credit ratings can also affect bank accounts, interest rates, utility provider applications and mobile phone contracts. One person said <em>‘Credit and credit ratings are a bit of a mystery to me. It’s something other people worry about.’</em></p><p>Find out <a title=\\\"How to check your credit report\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-to-check-your-credit-report\\\">how to check your credit report for free</a>, such as by using Noddle, and <a title=\\\"How to improve your credit rating\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/action_plans/how-to-improve-your-credit-rating\\\">how to improve your credit score</a>. </p><h2>5.Give up smoking </h2><p>If you’ve tried – and failed – to quit before, maybe money can be the motivation you need? According to Ash.org a 20-a-day smoker of a premium cigarette brand will spend about £2,900 a year on cigarettes. </p><p>If cigarettes are burning a hole in your budget, why don’t you set yourself a savings goal to work towards? If you take out the money you spend on cigarettes from your outgoings, you’re much more likely to reach your goal quickly. See our <a title=\\\"Set a savings goal guide\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-to-set-a-savings-goal\\\">guide on starting a savings goal</a>. </p><p>You’ll be amazed how much daily costs add up over time. And that extra cash could be working hard for you in a savings account or a pension pot instead of being smoked away. </p><p>Giving up smoking can be hard.

Forty one per cent are planning to spend less socialising, while more than a third (35%) say they will spend less on clothing. </p><p>More than a quarter (26%) say they plan to spend less on presents for others in 2015, while 25% will take a packed lunch to work to reduce day-to-day spending. </p><p>Cutting back on the non-essentials can be a great way to reduce spending and can quickly add up.

Or something that you already have? </p><p>According to our annual Christmas spending survey, 37% of UK adults received presents last year they didn’t want or haven’t used – worth an average of £54.21. </p><p>But stashing unwanted gifts in the back of the wardrobe and forgetting about them means you could be missing out. Most retailers have return policies – and if the item was bought online, they are obligated by law to provide one. Plus, the quicker you act the more likely it is you will be covered by return policies, and it’s less likely that you will forget about it too. </p><h2>Taking presents back to a shop </h2><p>Did you know that high street shops don’t have to accept non-faulty returns? But if they have a returns policy, they must stick to it. Check out the retailer’s website or the back of receipts to see how long you have to return the item. </p><p>You might not be able to get your money back though. Return policies may offer different ways of refunding you, including cash, exchange of goods or credit notes to buy other goods from the same retailer. </p><p>Where possible, keep the receipt and all packaging when you buy something. </p><h2>Online returns – why it’s worth the hassle of returns </h2><p>In our survey on online shopping earlier this year, more than half of shoppers said they were less likely to return <a title=\\\"Tips and tricks when buying online\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/smarter-shopping---tips-and-tricks-to-save-money-when-shopping\\\">items bought online</a>. Most said it was “too much hassle” to go to the effort of posting the item back. A total of 84% admitted they “don't completely understand” returns rules. </p><p>But you have more rights to return when you buy online, as you're not able to physically check out the product before you buy it. </p><p>The <a title=\\\"Knowing your consumer rights\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/news/protect-against-unexpected-costs-by-knowing-your-consumer-rights\\\">Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013</a> allow you to return (most) goods ordered at a distance – which means online, over the phone or via a catalogue. </p><p>There are a few exceptions to this rule. These include CDs, DVDs or software if you've broken the seal on the wrapping, perishable items, tailor-made or personalised items. </p><p>You have 14 days from receiving the item to return it. The retailer should refund you within 14 days of receiving the goods or getting proof you have returned them – whichever is sooner. </p><p>Remember this is the minimum online retailers should give you – and if their website offers a longer policy, they must stick to it. </p><h2>It was a present, I don’t have the receipt! </h2><p>If you wish to return a present, you'll need proof of purchase. The best way to do this is with a gift receipt, which doesn't show how much the item cost. </p><p>If you weren’t given one with your gift, you’ll need to ask for the receipt from the person who bought it for you. </p><p>This does have the potential to be awkward, but it’s better than having a present you won’t use. </p><p>Still too much hassle to return? According to a Mintel report in January 2014, 5.5% of people sold their unwanted gifts on eBay, so you could think about selling your gifts for a bit of extra dosh.

If the item you’ve bought doesn’t meet these criteria, you have the right to return it for a refund or replacement. </p><p>You’re legally allowed to return items up to six years after purchase. However, it does get more difficult to prove an item isn't faulty simply due to general wear and tear. </p>\",\"title\":\"Got a Christmas present you don't want?

But what exactly is a basic bank account and could it be the right decision for you? </p><h2> 1. What is a basic bank account? </h2><p>If you have financial difficulties such as a poor credit rating, you might not be able to open a standard bank account - and that's where basic accounts come in. </p><p>Basic bank accounts are generally simple, as they don’t offer an overdraft facility or cheque book. </p><p>With most accounts, you can deposit funds such as wages, salary, pensions and cheques for free; get money out over the counter or at an ATM; and pay your bills by Direct Debit or standing order. </p><p>As long as you have money in your account, you don’t usually have to pay for basic bank account services. </p><h2>2. How to get a basic bank account - the eligibility factor </h2><p>To get a basic bank account you have to be over 16 and have proof of identity and address. Some banks will only accept photo ID. </p><p>A basic bank account should be provided to any customer who isn't able to open a standard account, though some banks don't always do this. </p><p>If you want to know more about running a bank account and how it can help you keep on top of your finances, <a title=\\\"Running a bank account\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/running-your-bank-account\\\">read our guide</a>.  </p><h2>3. Basic bank accounts – what to watch out for </h2><p>At the moment, if there’s not enough in your account to cover a standing order or Direct Debit the bank can refuse to pay it – and you may be charged as much as £25 each time a payment is refused. </p><p>Before you get a basic bank account, make sure it offers the services you need – such as a debit card, Direct Debits or standing orders. You should also check you can use cash machines near your home or work for free as not all banks currently do.  </p><p>For more information, see our <a title=\\\"Basic bank accounts\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/basic-bank-accounts\\\">guide on basic accounts</a> and go to our current accounts comparison table and <a title=\\\"Basic bank account comparison\\\" href=\\\"https://compare.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/currentaccounts/Step1\\\">compare ‘basic accounts</a></p><h2>4. Basic bank account changes </h2><p>By the end of 2015, fees for unpaid payments or an overdrawn balance will be scrapped. Basic bank account holders will also be guaranteed a debit card, free access to Link cash machines and the same over the counter facilities as other bank customers. </p><p>Nine High Street banks have signed up, accounting for 90% of the UK current account market. </p><p>These include Barclays, the Co-operative Bank, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide, RBS Group (NatWest and Ulster Bank) and Santander. </p><h2>Maximising your income </h2><p>If you want to get on top of your money, budgeting can be a really good way to do this.

These new rules – designed to increase consumer protection and ensure lenders act responsibly – are the result of the financial regulator's comprehensive review of the mortgage market known as the Mortgage Market Review (MMR). </p><p>The process of getting a mortgage – or re-mortgaging - will be more detailed and is likely to take longer than before as lenders will now need to ask more questions about an individual’s financial circumstances and household expenses like childcare and utility bills. </p><p>If it's your first mortgage, see our <a title=\\\"First-time buyer advice\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/first-time-buyer-money-tips\\\">First-time buyer advice</a> for more details. </p><h2>Rules designed to stop homeowners overstretching </h2><p>The new rules will make sure anyone buying a home can not only afford the initial cost of buying the property, but are also able to manage repayments now and in the future – even if interest rates rise. </p><p>Money Advice Service research shows many homeowners have in the past failed to add up the true costs of affording their new home, causing financial difficulties for some. </p><p>Three in four first-time buyers admitted overstretching their budgets to get on the housing ladder, most because they’d fallen in love with their dream home and couldn’t resist it. </p><p>More than half found the total bill for buying their home – on top of the mortgage – to be higher than they expected by almost £1,300. </p><p>And once in their new place, more than half said day-to-day maintenance and bills turned out to be more than expected.  </p><p>Potential homeowners will have to provide more evidence than ever before, including: </p><p><strong> Proof of income </strong></p><p>Lenders may ask for evidence of income, which may include payslips and bank statements going back at least three months, or retirement income. Customers will need to tell their lender about their outgoings such as Council Tax and utility bills, and other associated living expenses. </p><p><strong>Evidence of ability to meet mortgage commitments </strong></p><p>Lenders will need proof a borrower can not only meet the initial mortgage repayment but also on-going costs, taking into account foreseeable changes in personal circumstances, maybe an expected drop in income resulting from starting a family or retiring. </p><p>Borrowers will also need to reassure lenders they could still make their repayment commitments if interest rates increased. For example, homeowners with a £140,000 mortgage, making monthly repayments of £749 at 3.4% APR, would have to find an additional £171 a month if interest rates were to rise by 2%. </p><p><img src=\\\"/images/interest-rates.jpg\\\"/>  </p><p>Our research also showed that if interest rates rose by 3%, almost half of first-time buyers would struggle to meet the additional £265 a month repayment sum. </p><p><a title=\\\"Action plan - work out what mortgage you can afford\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/action_plans/work-out-what-mortgage-you-can-afford\\\">Use our Action plan - Work out what mortgage you can afford</a></p><h2>Remortgaging  </h2><p>If you are remortgaging and are worried about meeting the new lending requirements, lenders may have some flexibility in the way your application is assessed, provided you’re not looking to increase the size of the loan. However, there are limited exceptions such as when the loan includes a product or arrangement fee.
