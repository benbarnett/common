In return you’ll get a guaranteed amount of interest. These new Pensioner Bonds will be available from National Savings &amp; Investments (NS&amp;I), and the interest rates could make them a better option than standard savings accounts or even ISAs. </p><h2>Here are 10 things you need to know about the Pensioner Bonds. </h2><p>1)    Anyone aged 65 or over will be able to get one for their savings. </p><p>2)    They're available <a title=\\\"NS&amp;I 65 guaranteed growth bonds\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http://www.nsandi.com/65-guaranteed-growth-bonds\\\">online at www.nsandi.com/65-guaranteed-growth-bonds</a>, by phone or by post, though it's first come, first serve so postal applicants may miss out. </p><p>3)    There are two types available.

That’s according to the Association of British Insurers. Without insurance, you’ll have to cover emergency expenses on your own – the British Consulate can’t help you. </p><p>You should make sure the policy you choose is right for your needs. For example, you might need additional cover for winter sports, or if you have a medical condition, you might need specialist insurance. </p><p>There is no point hiding any medical conditions from your insurer either, even if it means a more expensive outlay in the first place. You should include everything you can, including any regular tablets you take. If you fail to, you could end up invalidating your policy. </p><p>If you are travelling in Europe, you should also get a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC). With an EHIC, you get the same level of state-provided medical care as someone who lives in the country you’re visiting. However, the local level of care may not be the same as what you’d get in the UK, so an EHIC is not enough on its own. You should still get travel insurance that includes medical and repatriation cover. </p><p>It’s not just medical treatment. Most insurance policies will cover lost or stolen bags, personal liability and more. </p><p>Insurance is essential.

Make sure when paying for travel money that you use a debit card or cash. Credit cards class it as a cash withdrawal and often charge interest and a separate fee. </p><p>The best exchange rates are often online, but there are pitfalls to going down this route. For example, you could be looking at a delivery charge of up to £5 and you may not be given the option to choose what notes you want. </p><p>Taking foreign currency with you isn’t the only way to pay on holiday though. It might be easier – and even cheaper - to use your credit card or debit card abroad; get a pre-paid card; or use traveller’s cheques. Make sure you know the fees before you travel. Don’t forget, some banks will want you to notify them of any foreign travel beforehand to monitor card fraud. </p><p>Find out your options with our <a title=\\\"Foreign currency guides\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/buying-foreign-currency\\\">foreign currency guides</a>. </p>\",\"title\":\"Three tips for booking winter sun to beat the January blues\",\"titleTag\":\"\",\"metaDescription\":\"\",\"preview\":\"January is one of the most popular times of year to be searching for holidays and no wonder -   once the tinsel and turkey of Christmas fades, January can feel a long, grey month.\",\"publicationDate\":\"2015-01-07T09:31:49.221Z\",\"translationId\":null,\"locale\":\"en\",\"categories\":[],\"topic\":\"Tips and tools\",\"largeImage\":null,\"previewImage\":null},{\"id\":\"considering-untying-the-knot-the-first-things-you-need-to-know-about-divorce\",\"body\":\"<p class=\\\"intro\\\">January is traditionally a busy time for divorces. In fact, the first day back at work in January, which this year is 5 January, is nicknamed ‘Divorce Day’ by lawyers – the day in the year divorce proceedings are most likely to start. </p><p>If you are thinking about divorcing, it can seem like a daunting time. But there are things you can do to make sure you are armed with the correct information to help tackle divorce practicalities. </p><p>Here are six things you should consider. </p><h2>1.Work out how much professional help you need </h2><p>Do you need a solicitor? The answer depends on how complicated your finances are – and how amicable your split is. If you part on good terms and your finances aren’t too complicated, you don’t necessarily need one. You could arrange everything on your own or by using an online service, if you live in England or Wales. </p><p>If you do need more help, you can arrange for advice from a solicitor or mediator and do the paperwork yourself.

Try to reach an agreement about paying things such as bills as soon as you can because ignoring them could have implications for your credit rating or get you into debt. Plus, being able to agree on the smaller things puts you in a better position to reach agreement about the ‘bigger’ financial issues later on. </p><h2>3.Be prepared for the cost </h2><p>Divorce costs can be expensive, and unless you qualify for state help, it is something you and your ex-partner have to be prepared to pay for. </p><p>Whether or not you have to pay court fees will be dependent on your level of income and savings. Solicitor’s fees can add up, but if you are unable to pay upfront, there are other options. You should be wary of taking out a high interest loan however, as you may have trouble repaying it at a time when you are getting used to a change in your financial situation. </p><p> Let us help relieve the stress of divorce. Read our guide on how much <a title=\\\"How much divorce costs\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-much-does-divorce-or-dissolution-cost\\\">different divorce options cost</a>. </p><h2>4.Protect yourself and your finances </h2><p>Don’t forget to think about your own finances too. You will need to act quickly to protect them if the divorce is acrimonious. </p><p>If the home you shared is registered in your ex-partner’s name, you can register your interest to ensure it isn’t sold or re-mortgaged without you being told. </p><p>However, you should be aware that this doesn’t apply in Scotland. You have the right to live in the property for as long as you are married or in a civil partnership, but you will lose this right if you leave the property for two years or more. </p><h2>5.Don’t ignore your full mortgage payments </h2><p>If you have a joint mortgage, don’t forget that you are equally liable for the whole loan – not just repaying your half. So, if you keep up with your mortgage payments, but your partner doesn’t, you could find that both your credit ratings are affected. </p><p>Equally, if you have a joint bank account, you should inform your bank straightaway – if your partner racks up any debt, you will both be liable for it. </p><p>Find out more about <a title=\\\"Protecting your financial assets during divorce\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-to-protect-your-finances-during-divorce-or-dissolution\\\">protecting your financial assets</a>.  </p><h2>6.Call in an impartial third party </h2><p>Agreeing the financial terms of a divorce can be a long process. </p><p>A mediator can help you and your ex-partner to reach an agreement. A solicitor can also help you with this process, but if you require a lot of time with them, it can make reaching a settlement an expensive undertaking – so it is best to avoid arguing with your partner through a solicitor as much as possible. </p>\",\"title\":\"Considering untying the knot?

In fact, the first day back at work in January, which this year is 5 January, is nicknamed ‘Divorce Day’ by lawyers – the day in the year divorce proceedings are most likely to start.\",\"publicationDate\":\"2015-01-05T10:07:30.470Z\",\"translationId\":null,\"locale\":\"en\",\"categories\":[],\"topic\":\"None\",\"largeImage\":null,\"previewImage\":null},{\"id\":\"new-rules-could-make-it-harder-to-get-a-payday-loan\",\"body\":\"<p class=\\\"intro\\\">As the new year dawns, are you wondering how you'll pay the Christmas bills? If you were considering a payday loan, you may need to think again - new rules from 2 January mean getting one could be more difficult. </p><p>The changes mean borrowers should pay back less, and there will be stricter affordability checks and better advice for customers. </p><p>But fewer people are likely to be able to get their hands on this short-term, high-cost credit.  </p><h2>What’s changed? </h2><p>From 2 January no borrower will repay more in fees and charges than they initially borrowed and any fees incurred for a missed repayment will be capped at £15. Also, interest and fees charged can’t be greater than 0.8% a day of the money borrowed. This means lower costs for most borrowers, as the charges don’t grow quickly over a short period of time. </p><p>These changes are on top of those already announced in 2014. Among these are a limit on the number of times a lender is able to roll over your loan and the number of attempts lenders can make to take money from your account – both being limited to twice. </p><h2>How will the new payday rules affect potential borrowers? </h2><p>The new payday loan rules aim to increase protection for borrowers who are struggling to make repayments. They’re intended to lower the cost of borrowing and increase protection for those who are at risk of escalating debt. </p><p>However, it’s expected the limits on what lenders can charge could see many shut up shop, making it more difficult for some borrowers to find a willing lender. In fact, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates this field, estimates around 70,000 people won’t be able to get a payday loan as a result of the rule changes. </p><h2>Payday loan brokers </h2><p>It’s not just lenders who will need to change how they work, as payday loan credit brokers are also affected by the new rules. </p><p>Some people may have used a payday loan credit broker to help find the best loan for them in the past. But some of these firms haven’t made it clear they are a credit broker and not a lender, and have been charging unauthorised fees for services not provided. In many cases the customer was unaware they’d been charged. </p><p>From 2 January credit brokers are required to make it clear to borrowers who they are and what services that they provide, including a breakdown of any fees they charge.  They also need to explain when these fees must be paid. </p><p>Most people don’t need to use a broker as it’s not difficult to do a little research and go directly to the lender.

Is a family holiday or a new car on your radar? Or perhaps you’d like to know how to make your savings go further? </p><p>Of the three in five people who made a resolution for 2014, three-quarters told us they’d chosen to focus on money goals. </p><p>Whatever your resolution, our tips can help you make 2015 the year your money starts working for you. </p><h2>1.Make an effective budget </h2><p>To know where you can save, you really need to know what you spend, so budgeting is one of the most important things you can do to kick start your new money plans for the New Year. </p><p>Taking a look at your finances and finding subscriptions you can cancel, or shopping around to get cheaper insurance can add up to some big savings. Take a look at our <a title=\\\"Budget Planner\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/budget-planner\\\">Budget Planner</a> to see how you can take the first step towards better finances. </p><h2>2.Start saving </h2><p>When we asked members of our community, saving money was identified as a key goal for 2015, with people looking to save for a rainy day, holiday, new home or even next year's Christmas.  </p><p>This may seem challenging, but did you know that putting aside just £3 a day adds up to £1,095 over the course of a year? Put the money in a jar to watch it grow before your eyes – or even better, find a savings account that will <a title=\\\"Savings accounts\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/regular-savings-accounts\\\">help boost your money</a>. </p><p>Not sure how to find that £3? Well, could you get your caffeine fix by filling a Thermos at home, or walk to work instead of taking the bus? See our <a title=\\\"Cut Back Calculator\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/cut-back-calculator\\\">Cut Back Calculator</a> to find out where else you could cut back. The tool only takes five minutes to complete, but you could be rewarded with a nice boost in your savings. </p><h2>3.Take advantage of the increased cash ISAs allowance </h2><p>On 1 July 2014, Cash ISAs (Individual Savings Accounts) and Stocks and Shares ISAs were merged and renamed New ISAs – or NISAs with an increased allowance limit of £15,000. If you haven’t already taken advantage of your full allowance you have until April 5th 2015 to either open a new or put money into an existing ISA and take advantage of any tax free interest on your savings. </p><p>Next year’s ISA allowance is being increased to £15,240 from April 6th. However, watch out for teaser rates that lure you in only to drop after the introductory period, and do shop around to find the best available rates. </p><p>It always a good idea to set up a reminder to notify you when any bonus rate runs out to maximise your ISA returns. </p><h2>4.Check your credit report </h2><p>Struggling to get credit from your bank or a lender? It could have something to do with your credit report. A credit report details your credit history, including a list of all your accounts, and helps a company assess how risky it would be to lend to you. </p><p>Our research has shown two in three UK adults have never checked their credit report. </p><p>We asked our Tell MA Community about their experiences with credit reports. Many people didn’t know credit ratings can also affect bank accounts, interest rates, utility provider applications and mobile phone contracts. One person said <em>‘Credit and credit ratings are a bit of a mystery to me. It’s something other people worry about.’</em></p><p>Find out <a title=\\\"How to check your credit report\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-to-check-your-credit-report\\\">how to check your credit report for free</a>, such as by using Noddle, and <a title=\\\"How to improve your credit rating\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/action_plans/how-to-improve-your-credit-rating\\\">how to improve your credit score</a>. </p><h2>5.Give up smoking </h2><p>If you’ve tried – and failed – to quit before, maybe money can be the motivation you need? According to Ash.org a 20-a-day smoker of a premium cigarette brand will spend about £2,900 a year on cigarettes. </p><p>If cigarettes are burning a hole in your budget, why don’t you set yourself a savings goal to work towards? If you take out the money you spend on cigarettes from your outgoings, you’re much more likely to reach your goal quickly. See our <a title=\\\"Set a savings goal guide\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-to-set-a-savings-goal\\\">guide on starting a savings goal</a>. </p><p>You’ll be amazed how much daily costs add up over time. And that extra cash could be working hard for you in a savings account or a pension pot instead of being smoked away. </p><p>Giving up smoking can be hard.

Forty one per cent are planning to spend less socialising, while more than a third (35%) say they will spend less on clothing. </p><p>More than a quarter (26%) say they plan to spend less on presents for others in 2015, while 25% will take a packed lunch to work to reduce day-to-day spending. </p><p>Cutting back on the non-essentials can be a great way to reduce spending and can quickly add up.

Or something that you already have? </p><p>According to our annual Christmas spending survey, 37% of UK adults received presents last year they didn’t want or haven’t used – worth an average of £54.21. </p><p>But stashing unwanted gifts in the back of the wardrobe and forgetting about them means you could be missing out. Most retailers have return policies – and if the item was bought online, they are obligated by law to provide one. Plus, the quicker you act the more likely it is you will be covered by return policies, and it’s less likely that you will forget about it too. </p><h2>Taking presents back to a shop </h2><p>Did you know that high street shops don’t have to accept non-faulty returns? But if they have a returns policy, they must stick to it. Check out the retailer’s website or the back of receipts to see how long you have to return the item. </p><p>You might not be able to get your money back though. Return policies may offer different ways of refunding you, including cash, exchange of goods or credit notes to buy other goods from the same retailer. </p><p>Where possible, keep the receipt and all packaging when you buy something. </p><h2>Online returns – why it’s worth the hassle of returns </h2><p>In our survey on online shopping earlier this year, more than half of shoppers said they were less likely to return <a title=\\\"Tips and tricks when buying online\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/smarter-shopping---tips-and-tricks-to-save-money-when-shopping\\\">items bought online</a>. Most said it was “too much hassle” to go to the effort of posting the item back. A total of 84% admitted they “don't completely understand” returns rules. </p><p>But you have more rights to return when you buy online, as you're not able to physically check out the product before you buy it. </p><p>The <a title=\\\"Knowing your consumer rights\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/news/protect-against-unexpected-costs-by-knowing-your-consumer-rights\\\">Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013</a> allow you to return (most) goods ordered at a distance – which means online, over the phone or via a catalogue. </p><p>There are a few exceptions to this rule. These include CDs, DVDs or software if you've broken the seal on the wrapping, perishable items, tailor-made or personalised items. </p><p>You have 14 days from receiving the item to return it. The retailer should refund you within 14 days of receiving the goods or getting proof you have returned them – whichever is sooner. </p><p>Remember this is the minimum online retailers should give you – and if their website offers a longer policy, they must stick to it. </p><h2>It was a present, I don’t have the receipt! </h2><p>If you wish to return a present, you'll need proof of purchase. The best way to do this is with a gift receipt, which doesn't show how much the item cost. </p><p>If you weren’t given one with your gift, you’ll need to ask for the receipt from the person who bought it for you. </p><p>This does have the potential to be awkward, but it’s better than having a present you won’t use. </p><p>Still too much hassle to return? According to a Mintel report in January 2014, 5.5% of people sold their unwanted gifts on eBay, so you could think about selling your gifts for a bit of extra dosh.

If the item you’ve bought doesn’t meet these criteria, you have the right to return it for a refund or replacement. </p><p>You’re legally allowed to return items up to six years after purchase. However, it does get more difficult to prove an item isn't faulty simply due to general wear and tear. </p>\",\"title\":\"Got a Christmas present you don't want?

What is a basic bank account? </h2><p>If you have financial difficulties such as a poor credit rating, you might not be able to open a standard bank account - and that's where basic accounts come in. </p><p>Basic bank accounts are generally simple, as they don’t offer an overdraft facility or cheque book. </p><p>With most accounts, you can deposit funds such as wages, salary, pensions and cheques for free; get money out over the counter or at an ATM; and pay your bills by Direct Debit or standing order. </p><p>As long as you have money in your account, you don’t usually have to pay for basic bank account services. </p><h2>2. How to get a basic bank account - the eligibility factor </h2><p>To get a basic bank account you have to be over 16 and have proof of identity and address. Some banks will only accept photo ID. </p><p>A basic bank account should be provided to any customer who isn't able to open a standard account, though some banks don't always do this. </p><p>If you want to know more about running a bank account and how it can help you keep on top of your finances, <a title=\\\"Running a bank account\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/running-your-bank-account\\\">read our guide</a>.  </p><h2>3. Basic bank accounts – what to watch out for </h2><p>At the moment, if there’s not enough in your account to cover a standing order or Direct Debit the bank can refuse to pay it – and you may be charged as much as £25 each time a payment is refused. </p><p>Before you get a basic bank account, make sure it offers the services you need – such as a debit card, Direct Debits or standing orders. You should also check you can use cash machines near your home or work for free as not all banks currently do.  </p><p>For more information, see our <a title=\\\"Basic bank accounts\\\" href=\\\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/basic-bank-accounts\\\">guide on basic accounts</a> and go to our current accounts comparison table and <a title=\\\"Basic bank account comparison\\\" href=\\\"https://compare.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/currentaccounts/Step1\\\">compare ‘basic accounts</a></p><h2>4. Basic bank account changes </h2><p>By the end of 2015, fees for unpaid payments or an overdrawn balance will be scrapped. Basic bank account holders will also be guaranteed a debit card, free access to Link cash machines and the same over the counter facilities as other bank customers. </p><p>Nine High Street banks have signed up, accounting for 90% of the UK current account market. </p><p>These include Barclays, the Co-operative Bank, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide, RBS Group (NatWest and Ulster Bank) and Santander. </p><h2>Maximising your income </h2><p>If you want to get on top of your money, budgeting can be a really good way to do this.
